# School-Projects
This is where all the small projects I make for school go.

## DailyCalorieBurnTracker
### Prompt: 
> Imagine you are tasked with creating a basic simulation for a Daily Calorie Burn Tracker App. The app tracks a user's daily calorie burn based on their activity level and provides a motivational message based on their energy expenditure.  
> 1. Collect User Input:

> Ask the user for their name.
  Prompt the user to enter their weight.
  Ask the user to enter their step count for the day.  
> 2. Perform Calculations:  

> Estimate calories burned using the formula: Calories burned = steps × 0.04
 (Assumption: On average, a person burns 0.04 kcal per step.)  
> 3. Provide Motivational Feedback Based on Calories Burned:  

> If calories burned is:
Below 200 kcal → "Try to be more active! Every step counts."
Between 200 and 399 kcal → "You're on the right track! Keep it up!"
400 or more kcal → "Excellent effort! You're making great progress!"  
> 4. Display the Summary:  

> Print the calories burned and the motivational message.

## ConditionalLoops
### Prompt:
> Design a program with a loop that asks the user to enter a series of positive numbers. The user should enter a negative number to signal the end of the series. After all the positive numbers have been entered, the program should display their sum.

## KilometersMilesConvert
### Prompt:
> Design a modular program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, and then convert that distance to miles. The conversion formula is as follows:                                                                                                  `Miles = Kilometers * 0.6214`

## MonthlyTaxReport
### Prompt:
> A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the total sales for the month, and the amount of state and county sales tax collected. The state sales tax rate is 4 percent and the county sales tax rate is 2 percent. Design a modular program that asks the user to enter the total sales for the month. Using this amount, the application should calculate and display the following:  

> • The amount of county sales tax  
> • The amount of state sales tax  
> • The total sales tax (county plus state)  

> In the program, consider the county tax rate (0.02) and the state tax rate (0.04) as named constants.
