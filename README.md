This is where all the small projects I make for school go.

## DailyCalorieBurnTracker
### Prompt: 
"Imagine you are tasked with creating a basic simulation for a Daily Calorie Burn Tracker App. The app tracks a user's daily calorie burn based on their activity level and provides a motivational message based on their energy expenditure."

1. Collect User Input:

Ask the user for their name.
Prompt the user to enter their weight.
Ask the user to enter their step count for the day.
2. Perform Calculations:

Estimate calories burned using the formula: Calories burned = steps × 0.04
 (Assumption: On average, a person burns 0.04 kcal per step.)
3. Provide Motivational Feedback Based on Calories Burned:

If calories burned is:
Below 200 kcal → "Try to be more active! Every step counts."
Between 200 and 399 kcal → "You're on the right track! Keep it up!"
400 or more kcal → "Excellent effort! You're making great progress!"
4. Display the Summary:

Print the calories burned and the motivational message.
